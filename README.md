# morse-code

The program first builds a tree data structure made up of nodes representing characters and their corresponding symbols in the Morse encoding system.  The GUI interface allows the user to either encode an alphabetic string as Morse or decode Morse back the other way.  For some extra fun, the user can watch and listen to an encoding of their message.
